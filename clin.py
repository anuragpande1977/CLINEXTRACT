    This study evaluated the changes in symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in a large cohort of patients with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), managed under real-life clinical practice conditions.

    The researchers found that all medical treatments, including monotherapy with alpha-blockers (AB), 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARI), or the herbal extract hexanic extract of Serenoa repens (HESr), as well as combination therapies with AB+5ARI and AB+HESr, were associated with significant improvements in both LUTS symptoms and QoL...

    In conclusion, this large, real-world study demonstrates that the various medical treatments for managing moderate to severe LUTS/BPH, including the herbal extract HESr, provide equivalent improvements in symptoms and quality of life, with the herbal extract showing a better safety profile compared to standard pharmacological therapies.
